# 📖 **get_next_line**  
### 🛠️ **Reading a Line from a File Descriptor in C**  

---

## 🎯 **Overview**  
**get_next_line** is a project at **[1337 Coding School](https://1337.ma)** (part of the **42 Network**) where you create a function that reads a line from a file descriptor. This project teaches you how to handle **file I/O**, **static variables**, and **memory management** in C. It’s a great way to understand how to read and process data from files or standard input.

## 🧠 **What You'll Learn**  
- **📖 File Descriptors**:  
  Learn how to use file descriptors and system calls like `read` to read data from files or input streams.  
- **🧩 Static Variables**:  
  Use static variables to preserve data between function calls.  
- **⚙️ Memory Management**:  
  Manage dynamic memory allocation for strings and buffers.  
- **🧠 String Manipulation**:  
  Build functions to handle strings and extract lines from a buffer.
